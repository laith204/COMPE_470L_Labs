# COMPE 470L Labs â€“ Digital Design with Basys 3  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains lab projects for **COMPE 470L**, a digital design course focused on **FPGA development** using the **Basys 3 board** and **Verilog**. The labs cover key topics such as **state machines, LED control, counters, and UART communication**.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- **FPGA Board**: Basys 3 (Xilinx Artix-7)  
- **Language**: Verilog  
- **Software**: Vivado  

## ðŸ“‚ Lab Topics  
The repository is structured with separate folders for each lab. Topics include:  
- ðŸ”¹ **LED Control & Counters** â€“ Implementing basic logic and sequential circuits  
- ðŸ”¹ **State Machines** â€“ Designing and testing finite state machines  
- ðŸ”¹ **UART Communication** â€“ Serial communication with external devices  
- ðŸ”¹ **More to Come** â€“ Additional labs will be added as the course progresses  

## ðŸš§ Status: Work in Progress  
This repository is **actively being developed** as I progress through the course. Future updates will include additional labs, optimizations, and insights gained along the way.  

## âš¡ Challenges & Learning Experience  
- Getting familiar with the **Vivado** environment and FPGA toolchain  
- Debugging Verilog designs and understanding synthesis vs. simulation  
- Implementing efficient state machines and hardware design principles  

## ðŸ“œ Notes  
This repository serves as a learning resource, and the code may evolve over time as I refine my understanding of **FPGA design** and **hardware description languages**.
